# Big-Stack-Project-
A complete backend project

The Big Stack Project is like a Stackoverflow website in which the user can register himself/herself, login to their respective accounts and post a question with a snippet of their code that they are using so that other coders can help them.
This project is totally about the backend part and one can use postman to check its working areas, later they can use it to their own project and make a frontend interface using React, Vue or Angular. Big Stack Project has the power of database and authentication to the private routes for security.
